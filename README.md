# Autonomous Mobile Robot Demo

This project demonstrates the use of [RAI](https://github.com/RobotecAI/rai) framework interfacing with a robot. In particular, it shows the communication between Generative AI models and the [Husarion ROSbot XL](https://husarion.com/manuals/rosbot-xl/) - an autonomous mobile robot platform developed by [Husarion](https://husarion.com). 

The demo can be successfully run on any robot equipped with the same set of sensors and controlled using ROS 2 messaging protocols. Additionally, the same behavior can be reproduced in the simulation developed using [O3DE](https://www.o3de.org/) game engine. 

> **_NOTE:_**  This repository is not yet functional, as the demo is undergoing an internal review and development. The code will be fully usable and documented before [ROSCon 2024](https://roscon.ros.org/2024/).

## Demo description

The robot equipped with a microphone can listen to the commands and react accordingly. The demo is limited by the current Generative AI models linked via RAI framework and the robot's sensors. A simple proof-of-concept implementation shows, that robot can move through the room and describe what it sees.
